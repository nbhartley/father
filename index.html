	<p class="message">Thank you for everything you dad. You push me to be a better student, athlete, and person. It seems like yeaterday when you would take me to and from practice and stop at Wendy's on the way home to get an asiago chicken sandwhich to make me happy again. When I joined RAYS I wanted to quit swimming. It was hard, I wasn't as fast as the other kids, I didn't know anyone on the team and I wasn't sure if I even wanted to swim. I remember it was after a practice at the Charlotte avenue pool that I told you in the car I didn't want to swim anymore but you calmly replied, "Givce it two more weeks and if you still don't like it then you don't have to swim, but give it two more weeks". At the time I was annoyed that you were making me continue for two more weeks but boy am I glad you did. In those two weeks I met some of my closest friends on RAYS, started to like practice and saw that I was getting faster and realized this is something I wanted to do. If it wasn't for those two weeks and your continued support I wouldn't be where I am today. I wouldn't be at Duke, I wouldn't have made the liffelong friends I have today, and I wouldn't have all the memories swimming has gave me like when you shaved my legs at 6 in the morning before my first capital classic meet. I could go on and on about all the memories swimming has gave me and because of you and your support and pushing me, I am the person I am today. So all in all, thank you for always being there for me and being the greatest dad anyone could ask for. You are never mean, never forced me to go to practice, and you are always willing to teach/help me with anything. I hope to be as good as a dad you are one day and be able to fix or build anything just from Google and YouTube. </p>
